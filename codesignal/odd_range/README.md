## Question

You are given an integer `n` where n ranges from **1** to **10‚Å∏** , inclusive. Your task is to write a function that calculates and returns the product of the odd digits of n, without converting n into a string.

For example, if `n` equals `43172`, the output should be `21`, because the product of the odd digits `3`, `1`, and `7` is `21`.

Please note that if `n` has no odd digits, your function should return `0`.

You are expected to solve this task by using a `while` loop. Good luck!
